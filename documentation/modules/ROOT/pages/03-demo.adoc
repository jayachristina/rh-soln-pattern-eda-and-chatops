== Demonstration

[#demo-video]

In this video you can see xpto:

video::3yULVMdqJ98[youtube, width=800, height=480]

Next, you can learn how to walkthrough this demo.

== Setup the solution

To provision the demo you will perform the following steps - each of which are explained in detail in the next sections:

* Gain access to Red Hat OpenShift. This solution pattern has been tested on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/welcome/index.html[OpenShift 4.15^]
* Ensure you have the tools `oc` and `ansible` installed in your local environment such as your laptop
* Access the OpenShift cluster with cluster-admin privileges
* Log in to OpenShift with `cluster-admin` role via cli
* Run the Ansible playbook
* Run a  bunch of scripts to deploy the Solution Pattern in your OpenShift cluster

=== Pre-requisites
Here is the list of tools you need in your local enviroment so that you can use the automated installation.

* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[OpenShift CLI (oc client)^]
* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Ansible CLI ^] with https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/kubernetes/core/k8s_module.html[Ansible kubernetes.core module^]

To check if you have the cli tools, you can open your terminal and use following commands:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
oc version #openshift cli client
ansible --version
ansible-galaxy --version
ansible-galaxy collection list #the list should include kubernetes.core
----

If you can't see `kubernetes.core` collection listed, you can install it with `ansible-galaxy`:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install kubernetes.core
----


=== Installing the demo

* Login to your OpenShift cluster as cluster-admin (because a number of operators will need to be installed)
* Click on the username on the top right hand, and then click on *Copy login command*. This will open another tab and you will need to login again
* Click on *Display token* link, and copy the command under  *Log in with this token*. This will look like this
[source,shell script]
----
oc login --token=<token> --server=<server>
----

* Clone the ansible scripts as follows in an appropriate folder in your local environment

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
git clone <TBC>
----

Let's walk te. Ensure that the ansible playbook is deployed without errors

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
<TBC> ansible-playbook playbook.yml
----

* This is the output you get from the above ansible command:

[example]
----
PLAY RECAP ****************************************************************************************
<TBC>
----

That's it! You are set to try out this Solution Pattern! ｡◕‿◕｡

=== Personalize the instructions

To personalize the rest of the instructions to your OpenShift enviroment, 

* At the top-right of this page enter 
**  *subdomain* to match your OpenShift cluster under the *Your Workshop Environment* section 
* Press enter or click on the Set button
* The menubar and the rest of this walkthrough guide will be updated with the username and subdomain as shown below
